       <p>My name is Mico Enriquez, and I am an aspiring software developer. Currently I am enrolled in a condensed 6-month program called Year-Up, which provides college credited courses and an internship in the tech field. Throughout the program, I am learning and practicing different coding languages aswell as practicing some business practices like project managing. Some of the projects I am apart of through GitHub are on my link here. If you have any questions, comments, or concerns you can reach me at my LinkedIn.</p>
       
       <p>Prior to the Year-Up program I graduated with an Associates of the Arts degree through Pierce College and worked as a pharmacy technician. I have been wanting to get into tech since I was younger but didn’t have the courage or resources to do so. With my newfound courage and the availability of resources I have, I am ready to dive into the tech industry and what it has to offer. Aside from programming and being a student, I spend most of my time traveling, hiking, and experiencing the different culinary foods has to offer. As I mentioned earlier, my LinkedIn and other contact information are listed above if you want any recommendations on places to visit or food to try!</p>
